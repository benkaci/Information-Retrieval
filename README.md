# Information-Retrieval

This project demonstrates an information retrieval system, similar to google search using R. In this project I have created a corpus composed of a couple of sample documents. Additionally I have inputted a query. 
To find the document that best matches the query I have used a term document matrix, that gives words with the least frequency the highest score. I then use Cosine Similarity to find the document that best matches the query.
